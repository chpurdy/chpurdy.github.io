Wow, it's been a long time!  Re-reading these old posts got me thinking about how DIFFERENT this year is.  It's been over 2 years since my last post and so much has changed.  Virtual school (well, hybrid now, I guess) is challenging.  I can't really say with any certainty how much or how little many of my students are learning.  I would like to think they are internalizing the stuff we're doing, but who knows?

Well, this was just going to be a test post to see if this repl.it thing is going to work for editing Github Pages sites.
