It's Sunday night and we're getting ready to start the 5th week of school.  This coming weeks' activities are playing through my head and I'm trying to keep from forgetting things.

In AP CS we have worked with the Scanner class, modulus, arithmetic operations, and basic string operations.  This coming week, we will be going over basic void methods, conidtionals, and binary numbers.  Lots of new info!

In PreAP CS we are spending some more time with the Turtle module and students will be able to get creative by creating their own functions to draw a simple landscape of their choosing.  Halloween is coming, so I anticipate pumpkins and such.

In CS 1 we are going to continue on with formatting strings.  We'll start the week off with them making their own MadLibs in Python.  Then, I'll introduce defining functions with and without parameters.  

It's going to be a busy week, and with only 2 weeks left in the grading period, I'm expecting more and more students to start to care about their grades.  

I also have to write 6 week tests for each of my classes.  That alone will be a time consuming process that I'm not particularly excited to get started on.  I think that writing exams is probably my least favorite part of teaching (right up there with grading in general).  Perhaps I can find a faster way to write and grade these 6 week tests.  I'll have to give that some more thought.
