So it's getting towards the end of my boys' first week in Kindergarten.  They've done pretty well so far.  William had a rough day on Tuesday, but CJ has been happy the whole week.  Every time we leave school he says, "I like my school, I want to stay here ALL DAY!" Which is his way of saying he wants to stay forever.  Will, always the contrarion when it comes to CJ, disagrees and claims to not like it.  But, when I ask why not, he never gives a reason.  Upon further questioning he seems to really enjoy it, but just wants to disagree with CJ.  

The only trouble so far really has been that I have to drop them off so early (7am-ish) and their school doesn't start until 7:45.  This is primarily due to the really bad traffic near their/my school from about 7:15 until about 8:00.  Since they have to be there by 7:45 and I have to be at work by 8:00, I've decided to just plan on getting there really early and they can stay busy by reading books. 

Both boys say their favorite part of school is recess (boys after my own heart).  Besides recess, CJ said he really likes doing the puzzles, and William says he like "Brain Breaks."  My wife explained that this was something where the teacher puts on some music for a few minutes and the kids get to dance...giving their brain a break.  Makes sense. 

I started reading them <i>The Neverending Story</i> tonight.  We saw most of the movie while we were evacuated for Hurricane Harvey last week and they boys seemed to enjoy it (they did fall asleep though).  As for the book, we finished the introductory chapter and they also fell asleep.

As for the my oldest, he seems to be adjusting well to his new school. I went to four high schools so I know what it's like to change after your freshman year (and sophomore and junior).  It's not the easiest, but it's better now than after his junior or senior year.  He says he likes his schedule and really seems to like AP Biology.  He told me today about an experiment they did in class with chewing gum, measuring and calculating the amount of sugar intake while chewing a piece of gum.  Sounds interesting.  He is in my computer science class and is doing pretty well.  For the first few days of class (maybe even weeks), I have the students sit in different places and with different people.  This is to try to break up some of the clicks that tend to pre-form from previous classes and schools.  Also, it shows the students that "their" seat isn't really "theirs."  I think Andres has sat with a different girl every day...he is one of the first in class, so they're sitting with him, not the other way around.  My wife is  a little worried, but I'm confident he'll do us proud.  

I have gotten a few positive comments from students about the limited discussions we've had so far in my classes.  I think I'm being a bit more interactive, animated, etc. than the computer science teachers they've worked with in the past.  I've already told my AP kids that this is my first year teaching this particular AP class, so the pacing may seem a bit weird at times.  We've already lost a week to the storm, but I don't want to give them the impression of being too rushed.  I am going to have to work to keep the pace up to allow sufficient time to get everything they need for the AP exam in before May.

In AP CS, we've started off using Notepad++ and the command line to compile.  They've successfully written and compiled their "Hello, world!" program and a few other things.  In Pre-AP, we started with Python.  In both classes, I gave a very broad overview of open source and free software and we discussed some advantages to open source software.  In CS 1, the students are learning to think algorithmically using <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OGN091PuMtj8mrRLpfhV1oGJxz9dHDaqwJ-PGyenxbU/export?format=pdf">Code.org's Human Machine language</a>.  I think they're finding it pretty interesting. I have 100% engagement.  A few students have commented in excited voices how "hard" it is.  I remind them that on day 1, I said this is going to be a "hard" class.  Not hard like digging a ditch or even writing a paper, hard because they will be thinking in ways they've never had to think before.  It reminds me of a Dr. Seuss book, <i>Oh, the Thinks You Can Think!</i>
