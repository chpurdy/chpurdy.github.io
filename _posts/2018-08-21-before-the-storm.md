We have 3 planning days before the kiddos get here.  It's definitely the calm before the storm.  This year is looking promising so far.  

I've got 3 (or 4) preps:
* CS 1
* PreAP CS
* UT OnRamps CS
* Dual Credit Lab

I've had plenty of planning time this year, which is a nice change!  I've got the year basically planned out for all the classes, just have to get specifics done.  

I have the first 2 weeks of CS 1 completely done (presentations, assignments done).  After that we get into Python, so I tend to stay a little more flexible.  I have the order of assignments basically figured out. I've decided to start out with the Turtle in Python this year.  I liked how it went last year, but I introduced the Turtle *after* variables, data types, and functions.  This year, I'm going to use the Turtle to explore some of the basic constructs of programming: loops and functions.  I will probably use a little different vocabulary from the beginning too.  Last year I didn't use the word "module" until almost the 2nd semester, and we didn't talk about objects really until February.  I was trying to abstract out some of the details.  While this went OK, I think the kids can handle it and like a colleague of mine said, "They don't know this stuff is supposed to be hard!"  I think if I just introduce the vocabulary, they'll understand and it will make the lesson on OOP in January/February more of an ah-ha moment for them.

In PreAP we're going to start off with Boolean algebra and Digital Circuits.  I have a few students in the class interested in UIL CS and I think this discussion will benefit them.  **Plus**, it's a nice offline activity to start the year until schedules get ironed out.  I am hoping to have the students use breadboards to actually create some of the circuits that they are going to simplify/draw.  We'll see.

OnRamps is nice.  All of the curriculum is done for me.  I tend to not do well with following other people's curriculum.  But I'm hopeful this time.  I'm still not too thrilled with using Scratch, but I have almost convinced myself that the students will benefit from being required to use a more basic language.  At some point in their careers, they may be required to use a language they don't particularly like, but they will have to get over that bias and get the job done.  I don't know, maybe the bias is just mine.  

Unfortunately, the parent meeting for OnRamps isn't until **AFTER** the school year starts, so schedules will still be in flux for at least the first week.  This kind of messes up my timelines...but we'll adapt and overcome!  I am just hopeful that there are enough students interested in Computer Science to warrant another section.  *But*, if another section doesn't get made, I'll be fine with the dual credit group as well.

Anyway, I'm optimistic about the coming year.  Maybe I'll do a better job blogging this year than last.  I started off strong, but quickly stopped.  Maybe I'll make it to 10 weeks this time!
