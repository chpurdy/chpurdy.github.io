Welcome to my blog.  I'm still playing around with the setup, but my goal is to blog weekly this year.  

Tomorrow is the first day of school and I couldn't be more nervous/excited.  I will have about 90 CS-I students with no programming experience, 40 Pre-AP CS students with a year of experience in various languages (though I'm not 100% sure which yet) and 15 AP Computer Science A students with limited programming experience.  

For my CS-I and Pre-AP CS classes I plan on teaching Python using <a href="http://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e/"><i>Think Python 2nd Edition</i>by Allen Downey</a>.  I will plan on supplementing this with some other websites/materials, but I'm not sure what all just yet.

For AP CS I will use <a href="http://greenteapress.com/wp/think-java/"><i>Think Java version 6</i>by Allen Downey and Chris Mayfield</a>.  Again, I will supplement this with other materials.  

I chose the <i>Think *</i> books primarily because they are freely available on the web.  In my experience, most <emph>high school</emph> students don't appreciate having to carry around a textbook.  By having the PDFs available for these books, I hope to reduce their back strain if nothing else.  Also, having solutions available online (I hope) will be helpful so students can check their solutions and see some sample solutions.  Having worked through most of the exercises in both books and looking at the provided solutions, I feel pretty confident that I will be able to tell when a student's work is not their own.
